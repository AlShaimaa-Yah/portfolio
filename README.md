## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project
The code for the after optimization can be found [here](https://github.com/AlShaimaa-Yah/portfolio)

### Getting started
To test pagespeed, [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
What I Should fixes:
1. Optimize images
2. Eliminate render-blocking JS and CSS in above-the-fold content


#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html
1. Optimize images Google's PageSpeed tool provided two optimized images:
* profilepic.jpg
* pizzeria.jpg.
2. They were both sized and compressed. The original images file names were renamed with the suffix "-lg".
3. Eliminate render-blocking JS & CSS.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
